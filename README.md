 🎉 Welcome to my Data Visualization adventure! This repository documents my journey through the Data Visualization Certification course, where I learned how to transform raw data into compelling visual storytelling 🎈.





## 📚 Course Overview

### 📌 Data Visualization with D3
+ D3, or D3.js, stands for Data Driven Documents. It's a JavaScript library for creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations in the browser.
+ D3 is built to work with common web standards – namely HTML, CSS, and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).
+ D3 supports many different kinds of input data formats. Then, using its powerful built-in methods, you can transform those data into different charts, graphs, and maps.
### 📌 JSON APIs and AJAX
+ APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are like UIs for programs, enabling them to interact with each other by sending and receiving data.
+ APIs facilitate communication between computers, serving as tools for data exchange.
+ AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is commonly used by programmers to work with APIs.
+ AJAX involves making asynchronous requests to a server to transfer data, then displaying the received data on the page.
+ JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a typical format for data transferred between the browser and server in this context.
